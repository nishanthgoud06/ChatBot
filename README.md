## Data Pre-processing:
to preprocess the data with NLP we are going to implement tokenisation, and remove stop words,puntuations and streaming
we begin the process by converting the list of words by removing all spaces and tabs. then we are going to remove all the unnecessary symbols from the token list. and lastly, we are gonna use the nltk stemmer class to go through the token which has been generated in the previous step and implement steam on each of the tokens.
